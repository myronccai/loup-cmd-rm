# Run from source, e.g. `make run ARGS="-rv build/scratch"`. This uses
# Stage0's interpreter: under the self-hosted `loup run` of Loup 1.26.0,
# io.fs.listDir leaves out dot-files and remove/removeDir run the system's
# `rm -f`/`rm -rf`, so a directory that seems empty can still hold
# dot-files when it is deleted (`rm -d` removed such a directory). Stage0
# lists every entry and removes without a shell, as the native binary does.

# Tests import project modules by their path under source/ (`from cli.args
# import (...)`), the same way the sources do, so source/ goes on LOUPPATH.
# Narrow the run with TEST_ARGS, e.g. `make test TEST_ARGS="--filter value"`.
